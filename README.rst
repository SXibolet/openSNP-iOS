Apple Health client
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Currently under development**; the app is useless if downloaded now!

This iPhone app uploads your Apple Health data (phenotypes) to openSNP. Such data, along with `the genotyping you provided on openSNP.org`_, may help scientists find new associations.

You can submit feature requests for the app on `Issues`_.
